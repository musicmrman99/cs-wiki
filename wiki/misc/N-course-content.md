- Computational Thinking
  - Decomposition and Algorithms
    - Finding concepts that are relevant to a problem, and splitting up a problem into individually-solvable parts down to a series of discrete steps

  - Pattern Recognition, Abstraction, and Generalisation
    - Finding common and differing properties of domain concepts, processes, and data, and leveraging the commonalities

- Logical Reasoning
  - Constraints-based logic, eg.
    - "if it does X, then it must do Y, because it must be in state Z" (tracing)
    - "if it can't do X, then it can't do Y" (inference by constraint)
    - "if it can't do X, then it must do Y" (inference by exhaution)
    - in general, "given the set of all or a subset of possible inputs, what are the possible code paths that could be executed, and under what circumstances, to produce what outputs?"

- General skills
  - Modelling systems as data and functions/procedures (using known patterns and SCVA), including:
    - The ability to select and combine language features and library functions to create the desired algorithms and interactivity
    - The ability to bind (ie. define) data and behaviour at the right time and place based on the technical domain (eg. compile, build, deploy, configure, or run times) and real-world domain (eg. if buying something: add product, change product price, add discounts, product browsing, add to basket, payment, shipment, receipt, return shipment, return receipt, refund, etc.)

  - Logically analysing code to deduce variants, invariants, and code paths to determine what is and is not possible, and performing basic adjustments accordingly (usually for debugging)

- Algorithm design
  - Literals, variables, operators, constants, conditionals, iteration, functions, and events

- Data representations
  - Representing common media (text, images, video, audio)
  - How to use common fixed-size data structures (enumerations, records, classes)
  - How to use common variable-size data structures (arrays, maps, lists, trees, graphs)
  - Data types and their use in avoiding errors

- Modelling systems and managing complexity
  - Functional composition (how one function/procedure can call another to reuse common functionality), including scoping rules and closures
  - Structural composition (how data structures can contain and extend other structures to reuse common information), including encapsulation and interfaces

- Interacting with external systems (I/O)
  - (Local) databases
  - The file system (opening, reading, writing, flushing, and closing files)
  - The network (eg. basic HTTP GET requests, such as existing APIs)
  - Error handling

- Maths
  - Recursion
  - Graphs
  - Sets
  - Infinite sets and series
