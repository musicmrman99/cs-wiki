- we balance:
  - time
  - cost
  - scope (functionality)
  - quality (reliability, maintainability, etc.)

- different methodologies balance them in different ways:
  - In Waterfall methodologies, time, cost, and scope are fixed, and **quality** is allowed to vary
  - In some Agile methodologies (like XP and RAD), time, cost and quality are fixed, and **scope** is allowed to vary
  - In other Agile methodologies (like Kanban and sometimes SCRUM), cost, scope and quality are fixed, and **time** is allowed to vary
  - Few organisations can afford to vary cost, and those that can tend to only do so when the project's expected value is not directly financial profit (such as meeting legal requirements, some kinds of public sector projects, etc.)

- there is now a core body of knowledge for software engineering - the practices used in:
  - requirements development
  - functional design
  - code construction
  - integration
  - project estimation
  - cost-benefit trade-off analysis
  - quality assurance of all the above

- engineering requires practicality
  - meaning, the appropriate resources, time, scope, and quality for the project

  - we consider purpose
    - shed or house? quick time-saver, or high-quality extended-use product?

  - then, we iteratively optimise a formula (usually opaque) conisting of:
    - time to market
    - reliability
    - functionality
    - cost

- we need to consider:
  - the tools we use to build the software
  - the materials that go into the software itself
