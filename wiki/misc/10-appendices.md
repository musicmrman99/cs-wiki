## Appendix 1: Language Choice

Here's the short version ...

Disclaimer: The following is sometimes very flippant for comical effect and is far more exaggerated than my actual opinion or the truth. The opinions expressed are my own and not those of my employer.

Desktop Languages:

- **C++** is too bulky. It is a useful language to get to know, as it almost forces you to know what's going on from the computer's perspective, but it has a relatively steep learning curve.
- **Java** is too clunky. Too much Object-Oriented dogma (the Application is a class, ["no Verb is ever permitted to wander about freely"](https://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html), [Hello World, Enterprise Edition](https://github.com/Hello-World-EE/Java-Hello-World-Enterprise-Edition), ...) and a type system that is too limited. Since Java 8 (released March 2014, several centuries ago in Technology Time) they've been trying to fix some of the problems, with varying results.
- **C#** is "Java Improved", with only some of the same problems, but is tied too closely with the complex .NET framework, Windows APIs, and Microsoft ecosystem more broadly (I don't know C#, but that's the impression I get).
- **Swift** is a nice language from what I've heard, but is an Apple thing. I don't own a Mac.

Web Languages:

- **JavaScript** (JS) uses a rather convoluted system of prototypal OO and has over 20 years of language bloat and the many resulting pitfalls and old features you shouldn't use, but has very nice anonymous functions. ... [stares at the pretty functions] ...
- **PHP** as a language is fine, almost powerful even. Everything around the language is ugly - the runtime, the autoloader, the standard library, the documentation, the package manager, the ...
- **Ruby** is interesting from a theory standpoint, but has quite a strange syntax from what I can tell (I haven't used it much).
- **Perl** is hideous in too many ways to explain (thankfully, so far I've only had to use one-liners from Stack Overflow).
- **Rust** is "C++ Improved", and **Go** is also interesting (people are usually either a fan of both or a fan of neither, so I've put them together). Both are valid options, but are still a bit new to be used for learning (I think? I don't know these languages or their ecosystem).
